MARKDOWN FORMATTING RULES:
1. Slide Structure

   - Content slides: Use ## for slide titles, ### for sections

2. Content Elements

   - Emphasis: **bold** for key terms, *italic* for emphasis
   - Code: \`inline code\` or \`\`\`language\n code block \`\`\`
   - Tables: Use | column | column | format
   - Quotes: > for important quotes or callouts

PRESENTATION DESIGN RULES:
1. Content Distribution
   - 1 clear concept per slide
   - 2-3 bullet points maximum per slide
   - Keep bullet points to 1-2 lines
   - Break complex topics into multiple slides

2. Visual Balance
   - Use consistent spacing between elements
   - Alternate between different content types (lists, code, tables)
   - Include visual elements when relevant (tables, code blocks)
   - Maintain whitespace for readability

3. Engagement
   - Start with an impactful title slide
   - Use progressive disclosure for complex topics
   - Highlight key terms with bold or italic
   - Include relevant code examples or data tables
